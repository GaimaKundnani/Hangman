# Hangman
A Game of Hangman

Easy : the user will be given the chance to select
the list from which the random word will be
selected (Animal, Shap, Place). This will make it
easier to guess the secret word. Also the number
of trails will be increased from 6 to 8.
• Moderate: similar to Easy, the user will be given
the chance to select the set from which the
random word will be selected (Animal, Plant,
Place) but the number of trail will be reduced to
6. The last two graphics will not be used or
displayed
• Hard: The code will randomly select a set of
words. From this set the code will randomly
select a word. The uses will have no clue on the
secret word. Also, the number of trails will
remain at 6.
